# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Instructions

Recreate the app in the gifs above and below. The implementation should be such that any arbitrary rule, such as cannot type the letter ‘x’ or cannot exceed a certain length, could be applied and what we see in the form will always be in sync with React state. (a controlled component, React is in charge). http://g.recordit.co/XaBNXm7VsV.gif
